Description
===========

rsstodolist is a service to build RSS feed, hosted on Google App Engine, at https://rsstodolist.appspot.com.
You can deploy the server code on your own server (https://github.com/paulgreg/rsstodolist-server) to host your private instance.

This is the rsstodolist add-on for Firefox and Chrome, allowing to add URL to a RSS feed, available on the [Mozilla Add-on repository](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/rsstodolist/) and [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rsstodolist-extension/gjnfedompndjcoeannmcppbckbkjhpkd).

It uses the [Web Extension API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions) which make it compatible between Firefox and Chrome.
